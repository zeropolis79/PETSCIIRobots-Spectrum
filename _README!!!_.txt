This code is provided AS IS. It is guaranteed that it is the same exact
code that the ZX Spectrum 48K verion(s) has been built from, so it is
compilable and working.

However, NO SUPPORT IS PROVIDED TO THE CODE. It is supposed that you are
qualified enough to figure out it all on your own, and to solve both
possible issues with the code and with your platform of choice as well.

It is compiled with the latest SjAsmPlus.

You need to edit paths in the compile.bat and compile_release.bat

compile.bat 				creates a snapshot with some featured
                            disabled, for quick tests
compile_all_versions.bat 	compiles all four versions and pack them
                            into TAP files
compile_release.bat 		is used by the above script and not
                            supposed to be run directly
